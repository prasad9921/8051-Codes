8051 microcontroller programming

This repo contains Embedded Systems projects and some useful code snippets written ins assemble language.

Assembly language, often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. </br>
An assembly language is a type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware. Unlike machine language, which consists of binary and hexadecimal characters, assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans.

8051 Micorcontroller:
8051 microcontroller is designed by Intel in 1981. It is an 8-bit microcontroller. It is built with 40 pins DIP (dual inline package), 4kb of ROM storage and 128 bytes of RAM storage, and 2 16-bit timers. It consists of four parallel 8-bit ports, which are programmable as well as addressable as per the requirement.</br>
It is generally used for transferring the data from Central Processing Unit to Memory. Data bus: 8051 microcontroller is consisting of 8 bits data bus.
